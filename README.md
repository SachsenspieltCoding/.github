## About Me

I'm a passionate developer for Full-Stack web applications. But I also have interests in game development. 

In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also passionate about German railroading and firefighting, which are two of my other interests.

My current focus is on:


### âœ¨ Vertretungsapp
Vertretungsapp is an alternative to the indiware app VpMobil. Currently I am working on a complete recode and UI overhawl, you can explore the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vertretungsapp/).

### âœ¨ NPLAY
NPLAY is one of the biggest simulation youtubers in Germany. Together with some other devs I'm working on a custom moderation bot for his [discord server](https://discord.gg/nplay). You can find the bot [here](https://github.com/nplay-team/moderation-bot).

### âœ¨ Cubyx Network
I serve as the Lead Developer and administrator for Cubyx Network, where I'm actively working on developing the website. You can follow our progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cubyx-Network/website).

Feel free to explore these projects, contribute, or reach out to me with any questions or collaboration opportunities. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and open-source enthusiasts.
